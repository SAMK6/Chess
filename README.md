# ChessBot
Learning about chess engines. Goal to eventually set my bot up with a lichess bot account and see its rating.

### Notes
- UCI interface
- BitBoard internal representation
- Magic BitBoard move generation
- 110 byte lightweight board state
- copy/make move making scheme
- using `pthreads.h` so the bot musst run in a POSIX environment like linux or macOS, for windows you will need a compatibility layer
- testing with cutechess (integration testing), and custom tests (unit testing)

### TODO
- improve makefiles
