# ChessBot
Learning about chess engines. Goal to eventually set my bot up with a lichess bot account and see its rating.

### Notes
- UCI interface
- BitBoard internal representation
- Magic BitBoard move generation
- 109 byte lightweight board state
- copy/make move making scheme
- using `pthreads.h` and `regex.h` so will only support unix based systems for now (MacOS, Linux, etc)
- testing with cutechess (integration testing), and custom tests (unit testing)

### TODO
- UCI interface
- improve makefiles
