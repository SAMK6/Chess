# Chess
Learning about chess engines. Goal to eventually set my bot up with a lichess bot account and see its rating.

### Notes
- using UCI interface
- BitBoard internal representation
- testing with cutechess

### Name Ideas
- Once work on the translator, move generator, UCI interface, and (very) basic tree search functionality are done, MARK1 will be called GreedyBot because ill implement a simple material based eval function to test and play the first games againts the bot
