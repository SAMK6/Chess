Learning about chess engines. Goal to eventually set my bot up with a lichess bot account and see its rating.

### Notes
- UCI interface
- BitBoard internal representation
- Magic BitBoard move generation
- 109 byte lightweight board state
- copy/make move making scheme
- testing with cutechess and custom tests

### TODO
