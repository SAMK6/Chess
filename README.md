# Chess
Learning about chess engines. Goal to eventually set my bot up with a lichess bot account and see its rating.

### Notes
- using UCI interface
- BitBoard internal representation
- testing with cutechess

### TODO
- move generator
- basic search function (basic minimax)
- UCI compliance

### Name Ideas
- first one will be greedybot since its eval function will be purely material based
